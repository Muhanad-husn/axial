"""Source router (issue #167, PRD §7.8 / §5 step 2b / §8 P0-4; issue #172):
the single, shared classification that maps a structural `label` -- either
docling's own token (§7.4) or, on the Unstructured fallback extraction path
(P0-2), `unstructured`'s PascalCase `element.category` spelling -- to exactly
one of three routes -- `PROSE`, `ARTIFACT`, `APPARATUS` -- so that no
downstream pass (chunk, artifact, tag, cross-reference) re-derives the
prose/non-prose decision for itself (§7.8 "one shared classification"). The
router reads the persisted tree only; it triggers no re-extraction and calls
no model.

**Routes and the `label` -> route mapping (§7.8):**
- **prose** -- `text`, `section_header`, `title`, and an in-body `list_item`.
  The only blocks that ever reach the chunk stage (§7.7).
- **artifact** -- `table`, `picture`, `caption`. Routed to the artifact pass
  (§5 stage 5); never chunked. (`caption` is typed `prose` in the raw tree
  today -- routing on `label`, not `type`, is what reclassifies it.)
- **apparatus** -- `document_index` (TOC/index), `footnote`
  (endnotes/footnotes), `page_header`, `page_footer`, and a `list_item` whose
  enclosing section is back-matter. **Dropped:** not chunked, not
  artifact-noted; each drop is recorded with a reason (§7.8 "single source of
  skip truth").

**Label normalization (issue #172).** `route_for` and `apparatus_reason`
first resolve `label` to a canonical docling token via a shared alias table
(`_canonical_token`) before consulting the mapping above. Docling's own
tokens resolve to themselves; Unstructured's disjoint `element.category`
spellings (e.g. `Header`, `Table`, `ListItem`) resolve to the docling token
they mean (`page_header`, `table`, `list_item`), so both extraction paths
share the one classification. A label that is neither a docling token nor a
known Unstructured alias passes through unchanged and falls through to the
fail-open rule below -- the alias table is not a catch-all.

**Unknown label fails open to prose.** A block whose `label` is absent,
empty, or not in the mapping routes to prose, never silently dropped (§7.8) --
a misclassified block surfaces as visible prose to be caught and corrected,
rather than vanishing.

**`list_item` under back-matter.** A `list_item` is prose BY DEFAULT (in-body
lists are chunked); it is apparatus ONLY when its enclosing section is
back-matter (e.g. a bibliography/reference list rendered as list items).
`route_for` takes that context as the `in_back_matter_section` keyword --
callers decide "is this list_item's enclosing section back-matter" (typically
via `axial.chunk._is_back_matter` on the section's own heading) and pass the
answer in; the router itself never inspects the tree structure to find an
"enclosing section" -- that is the tree-walk caller's job (see
`iter_routed_blocks` below).
